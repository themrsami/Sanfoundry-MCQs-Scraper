# Sanfoundry_MCQs_Extractor

Sanfoundry MCQ Scraper
This scraper extracts MCQs (Multiple Choice Questions) from a Sanfoundry webpage and saves them to an HTML file. The HTML file contains the MCQs, options, and answers in a quiz format. The user can click on the options to see if they are correct or incorrect. The code also adds a button after each MCQ that allows the user to view the answer and explanation when clicked. The answer and explanation are initially hidden and are only displayed when the button is clicked. Clicking the button again will hide the answer and explanation.

How to use
Open the Sanfoundry webpage containing the MCQs that you want to scrape.
Open the Chrome developer console by pressing Ctrl + Shift + I (Windows) or Cmd + Option + I (Mac).
Copy the entire code from this repository and paste it into the console.
Press Enter to run the code.
An HTML file named mcqs.html will be downloaded to your computer.
Open the downloaded file in a web browser to view the extracted MCQs in a quiz format.
Customization
You can customize the appearance of the quiz by modifying the CSS in the code. You can also modify the code further to add additional functionality or change its behavior.
